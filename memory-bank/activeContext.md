# Active Context: CompassAI

## Current Work Focus
Fixed incorrect image URL construction on the frontend, preventing uploaded images from displaying.

## Recent Changes
- **Fix Frontend Image URL Construction:**
    - Modified `frontend/client/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx` to correctly construct the `src` attribute for displaying uploaded images.
    - Implemented a more robust method using the `URL` object's `origin` property to get the base server address from `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (removing any `/api/v1` path) before appending the relative `/uploads/...` path. This resolves the issue where images were not displaying.
- **Fix OpenAI Vision Input Formatting:** (Previous Task)
    - Corrected the `image_url` structure for OpenAI/Perplexity API calls in `backend/controllers/chatMessages.js`.
- **Fix Vision Input ReferenceError:** (Previous Task)
    - Adjusted code order in `backend/controllers/chatMessages.js` to fix variable initialization error.
- **Enable Vision for GPT-4.1 Series:** (Previous Task)
    - Updated `backend/controllers/providers.js` to flag GPT-4.1 models as supporting vision.
- **AI Vision Input Implementation:** (Previous Task)
    - Implemented backend logic and frontend UI for multimodal input (text + image) for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini models.
- **File/Image Previews & Paste Functionality:** (Previous Task)
    - Implemented user-facing file/image previews, paste support, and rendering in chat. Configured backend static file serving.

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md`.
- Present the completed task (bug fix) to the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Identified the root cause of broken images as incorrect URL construction on the frontend due to including `/api/v1` from the base API URL.
- Refactored URL generation using `URL.origin` for robustness.
