# Active Context: CompassAI

## Current Work Focus
Placing the "Start New Chat" button below the prompt shown when no chat is selected.

## Recent Changes
- Reverted the previous change that added the "Start New Chat" button when a chat session was open but empty.
- Added the "Start New Chat" button to `frontend/client/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`. This button now appears centered *below* the "Select a chat or start a new one." message, which is displayed when no chat session is currently selected (`currentSession` is null). It uses the existing `handleNewChat` function.
- Analyzed backend models (User.js, Setting.js).
- Examined backend controllers (settings.js).
- Reviewed frontend components (SettingsPage.tsx, ChatPage.tsx).

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md` to reflect the final placement of the new button.
- Present the completed task to the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Placed the button in the area shown when no chat is selected, as per user request.
- Ensured the button uses the existing `handleNewChat` function.
- Used translation function `t` for the button text for localization.
- Reused existing CSS class `styles.sendButton` for styling.
- Ensuring that the Memory Bank is comprehensive and up-to-date.
