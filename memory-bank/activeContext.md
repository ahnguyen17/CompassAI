# Active Context: CompassAI

## Current Work Focus
Setting the "brain" toggle (reasoning/streaming) on the chat input screen to be enabled by default.

## Recent Changes
- **Set "Brain" Toggle Default:** Modified `frontend/client/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx` to initialize the `showReasoning` state variable to `true`. This makes the reasoning/streaming toggle enabled by default when the chat page loads.
- Placed the "Start New Chat" button below the prompt shown when no chat is selected in `frontend/client/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`.
- Reverted the previous change that added the "Start New Chat" button when a chat session was open but empty.
- Analyzed backend models (User.js, Setting.js).
- Examined backend controllers (settings.js).
- Reviewed frontend components (SettingsPage.tsx, ChatPage.tsx).

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md` to reflect the new default behavior of the "brain" toggle.
- Present the completed task to the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The "brain" toggle controls both the display of reasoning steps and the enabling of streaming responses. Setting its default state to `true` enables both features by default.
- Identified the `showReasoning` state in `ChatPage.tsx` as the controlling variable.
- Ensuring that the Memory Bank is comprehensive and up-to-date.
