## Current Work Focus
Completing the UI redesign of `ChatPage.tsx` and resolving associated TypeScript errors.

## Recent Changes
- **Correct `ChatPage.tsx` Extraneous Text:**
    - Used `write_to_file` to remove unintentionally appended text (tool error messages) from `ChatPage.tsx`, restoring it to its correct code content ending with `export default ChatPage;`.
- **TypeScript Error Resolution (Partial):**
    - **`vite-env.d.ts`:**
        - Added module declarations for `react-router-dom`, `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`, `react-i18next`, `react-syntax-highlighter`, and `react-syntax-highlighter/dist/esm/styles/prism` to resolve module not found errors.
        - Provided more specific type signatures for `useParams`, `useNavigate`, `Link`, and `useLocation` from `react-router-dom` to fix type argument and export errors.
        - Added `ImportMetaEnv` interface and extended `ImportMeta` to resolve `import.meta.env` errors.
    - **`ChatPage.tsx`:**
        - Attempted multiple strategies to resolve a persistent "Parameter 's' implicitly has an 'any' type" error on line ~694-699 within a `sessions.map(...)` call. The error remains despite explicit typing and structural changes. This error is currently being monitored.
- **Build Error Resolution (Netlify):**
    - Installed `react-icons` dependency in `frontend/client` to resolve "Cannot find module 'react-icons/md'" (TS2307) error during Netlify build.
- **UI Redesign of `ChatPage.tsx` (Ongoing):**
    - **Input Controls:**
        - Relocated the Microphone button (`MdMic` / `MdMicOff`) into the main input controls bar, between the textarea and the Send button.
    - **Icon Buttons:**
        - Replaced the text-based "Share" / "Unshare" button with an icon button (`MdShare` / `MdLinkOff`).
        - Updated the "New Chat" button in the sidebar header to use an icon (`MdAddCircleOutline`) and call the `startNewChat` action from `authStore`.
- **Previous Fix (TS2719 Error in ChatPage):**
    - **Frontend (`ChatPage.tsx`):** Updated the local `CustomModelData` interface definition to include `baseModelSupportsVision: boolean;`.

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md`.
- Trigger a new Netlify build to confirm the `react-icons` module error is resolved.
- Continue UI refinement for `ChatPage.tsx` if any further specific changes are requested.
- Test `ChatPage.tsx` functionality thoroughly.
- Present the completed UI redesign and TypeScript error resolution efforts to the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The persistent "implicit any" TypeScript error in `ChatPage.tsx` (line ~694-699) is being monitored. Further UI work will proceed, and this error will be revisited if it blocks compilation or causes runtime issues.
- UI changes are focused on using `react-icons` and leveraging existing CSS in `ChatPage.module.css`.
