## Current Work Focus
Fixing issue where clicking the Navbar "New Chat" icon doesn't immediately update the chat window.

## Recent Changes
- **Centralized Session State:**
    - Moved session list state (`sessions`), loading (`sessionsLoading`), error (`sessionsError`), and fetching/deleting logic (`fetchSessions`, `deleteSession`) from `ChatPage.tsx` to the global store (`frontend/client/src/store/authStore.ts`).
    - Updated the `startNewChat` action in the store to prepend the new session to the global `sessions` list before navigating.
    - Refactored `ChatPage.tsx` to use the global session state and actions from `useAuthStore`, removing local state/functions for sessions.
- **Navbar "New Chat" Icon:** (Previous Task)
    - Added a `startNewChat` async function to `frontend/client/src/store/authStore.ts`.
    - Modified `frontend/client/src/components/Navbar.tsx` to add the icon button and link it to the `startNewChat` action.
- **Model Dropdown Color Update:** (Previous Task)
    - Modified `frontend/client/src/components/ModelSelectorDropdown.module.css`.
    - Changed the `color` rule for `.modelItem` in light mode to `#34495e`.
- **Custom Model Deletion Fix:** (Previous Task)
    - Modified `backend/controllers/customModels.js`.
    - Replaced `model.remove()` with `CustomModel.findByIdAndDelete()`.
- **Settings Page UI Update:** (Previous Task)
    - Modified `frontend/client/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` to use collapsed `<details>` elements.
- **Load Last Viewed Session:** (Previous Task)
    - Added `lastAccessedAt` to `ChatSession` model and updated controllers to use it for sorting and updates.

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md` in the Memory Bank.
- Present the completed task (centralized session state) to the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Centralized chat session list management in `authStore.ts` to ensure UI consistency when sessions are created or deleted from different components (like the Navbar).
