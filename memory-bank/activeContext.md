## Current Work Focus
Fixed an OpenAI API error related to incorrect image URL formatting for vision models.

## Recent Changes
- **Fix OpenAI Vision Input Formatting:**
    - Corrected the structure of the `image_url` field in the multimodal content array within `backend/controllers/chatMessages.js` when formatting requests for OpenAI/Perplexity.
    - Ensured the `image_url` value is an object `{ "url": "data:..." }` instead of just the data URI string, resolving the "400 Invalid type... expected an object, but got a string" error.
- **Fix Vision Input ReferenceError:** (Previous Task)
    - Adjusted code order in `backend/controllers/chatMessages.js` to ensure `modelIdentifierForApi` is initialized before use.
- **Enable Vision for GPT-4.1 Series:** (Previous Task)
    - Updated `backend/controllers/providers.js` to flag GPT-4.1 models as supporting vision.
- **AI Vision Input Implementation:** (Previous Task)
    - Implemented backend logic and frontend UI for multimodal input (text + image) for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini models.
- **File/Image Previews & Paste Functionality:** (Previous Task)
    - Implemented user-facing file/image previews, paste support, and rendering in chat. Configured backend static file serving.

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md`.
- Present the completed task (bug fix) to the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Corrected the payload structure for OpenAI/Perplexity vision API calls to match documentation requirements.
- Prioritized fixing the API 400 error.
