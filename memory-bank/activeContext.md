## Current Work Focus
Debugging and fixing the error encountered when deleting custom models.

## Recent Changes
- **Custom Model Deletion Fix:**
    - Modified `backend/controllers/customModels.js`.
    - Replaced the deprecated `model.remove()` method with the recommended `CustomModel.findByIdAndDelete(req.params.id)` in the `deleteCustomModel` function to potentially resolve a 500 Internal Server Error.
- **Settings Page UI Update:** (Previous Task)
    - Modified `frontend/client/src/pages/SettingsPage.tsx`.
    - Removed the `open` attribute from the `<details>` tags for the "User Management", "Model Visibility", and "Custom Providers & Models" sections, making them collapsed by default.
    - Converted the "Usage Statistics" section from a `<section>` to a collapsed `<details>` element.
- **Load Last Viewed Session:** (Previous Task)
    - Added `lastAccessedAt` field (Date, default: `Date.now`) to `backend/models/ChatSession.js`.
    - Modified `backend/controllers/chatMessages.js`:
        - Updated `lastAccessedAt` to `Date.now()` in `getMessagesForSession` (when viewing).
        - Updated `lastAccessedAt` to `Date.now()` in `addMessageToSession` (when interacting).
    - Modified `backend/controllers/chatSessions.js`:
        - Changed sorting in `getChatSessions` from `createdAt: -1` to `lastAccessedAt: -1`.
- Updated Memory Bank (`systemPatterns.md`, `progress.md`).

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md` in the Memory Bank.
- Present the completed task (custom model deletion fix) to the user and ask them to test the deletion again.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Identified the use of a deprecated Mongoose method (`.remove()`) as the likely cause of the 500 error during custom model deletion.
- Switched to the modern `findByIdAndDelete()` method for better compatibility and reliability.
