## Current Work Focus
Testing and finalizing the S3 file deletion feature upon chat session deletion. Previously, the focus was on UI redesign of `ChatPage.tsx` and resolving TypeScript errors.

## Recent Changes
- **S3 File Deletion on Session Delete:**
    - Modified `backend/controllers/chatSessions.js` in the `deleteChatSession` function.
    - Added logic to fetch `ChatMessage` documents that have associated `fileInfo`.
    - For each such message, the S3 object key (`fileInfo.filename`) is retrieved.
    - An `S3Client` is initialized, and `DeleteObjectCommand` is sent to AWS S3 to remove the file.
    - Errors during S3 deletion are logged, but the process continues to delete MongoDB records for `ChatMessage` and `ChatSession`.
    - Imported `S3Client` and `DeleteObjectCommand` from `@aws-sdk/client-s3`.
- **Correct `ChatPage.tsx` Extraneous Text:**
    - Used `write_to_file` to remove unintentionally appended text (tool error messages) from `ChatPage.tsx`, restoring it to its correct code content ending with `export default ChatPage;`.
- **TypeScript Error Resolution (Partial):**
    - **`vite-env.d.ts`:**
        - Added module declarations for `react-router-dom`, `react-markdown`, `remark-gfm`, `react-i18next`, `react-syntax-highlighter`, and `react-syntax-highlighter/dist/esm/styles/prism` to resolve module not found errors.
        - Provided more specific type signatures for `useParams`, `useNavigate`, `Link`, `useLocation`, `Routes`, `Route`, `Navigate`, `Outlet`, and `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom` to fix type argument and export errors.
        - Added `ImportMetaEnv` interface and extended `ImportMeta` to resolve `import.meta.env` errors.
    - **`ChatPage.tsx`:**
        - Attempted multiple strategies to resolve a persistent "Parameter 's' implicitly has an 'any' type" error on line ~694-699 within a `sessions.map(...)` call. The error remains despite explicit typing and structural changes. This error is currently being monitored.
- **Build Error Resolution (Netlify):**
    - Installed `react-icons` dependency in `frontend/client` to resolve "Cannot find module 'react-icons/md'" (TS2307) error during Netlify build.
    - Updated `vite-env.d.ts` to include declarations for `Routes`, `Route`, `Navigate`, `Outlet`, and `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom` to resolve TS2305 errors.
- **UI Redesign of `ChatPage.tsx`:**
    - **Input Controls:**
        - Relocated the Microphone button (`MdMic` / `MdMicOff`) into the main input controls bar, between the textarea and the Send button.
    - **Icon Buttons:**
        - Replaced the text-based "Share" / "Unshare" button with an icon button (`MdShare` / `MdLinkOff`).
        - Updated the "New Chat" button in the sidebar header to use an icon (`MdAddCircleOutline`) and call the `startNewChat` action from `authStore`.
    - **Mobile Responsiveness:**
        - Updated `ChatPage.module.css` to improve layout on smaller screens:
            - Removed fixed left margin from the main chat area header.
            - Allowed chat title to wrap.
            - Set `flex-wrap: nowrap` for the Model Selector and Reasoning Toggle row to keep them on a single line, reverting the previous wrapping strategy.
            - Ensured message bubbles maintain a `max-width` of `85%`.
- **Previous Fix (TS2719 Error in ChatPage):**
    - **Frontend (`ChatPage.tsx`):** Updated the local `CustomModelData` interface definition to include `baseModelSupportsVision: boolean;`.

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md` to reflect the S3 file deletion feature.
- Thoroughly test the chat session deletion functionality to ensure S3 files are removed and MongoDB records are cleaned up correctly.
- Test error handling for S3 deletion (e.g., if a file doesn't exist or S3 permissions are incorrect).
- Trigger a new Netlify build to confirm the `react-icons` module error is resolved.
- Continue UI refinement for `ChatPage.tsx` if any further specific changes are requested.
- Present the completed S3 file deletion feature and previous UI/TypeScript work to the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- S3 file deletion errors are currently logged, and the MongoDB cleanup proceeds. This prevents orphaning DB records if S3 is temporarily unavailable but means some S3 files might remain if deletion fails persistently. This behavior can be revisited if stricter error handling (e.g., halting DB deletion on S3 error) is required.
- The persistent "implicit any" TypeScript error in `ChatPage.tsx` (line ~694-699) is being monitored. Further UI work will proceed, and this error will be revisited if it blocks compilation or causes runtime issues.
- UI changes are focused on using `react-icons` and leveraging existing CSS in `ChatPage.module.css`.
