## Current Work Focus
Enabled vision capabilities for GPT-4.1 series models.

## Recent Changes
- **Enable Vision for GPT-4.1 Series:**
    - Verified that `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, and `gpt-4.1-nano` support vision input via the API.
    - Updated `backend/controllers/providers.js` to set `supportsVision: true` for these three models in the `AVAILABLE_MODELS` list.
    - No further code changes were needed as the existing OpenAI vision handling logic in `chatMessages.js` and the frontend's dynamic icon display in `ModelSelectorDropdown.tsx` cover these models.
- **AI Vision Input Implementation:** (Previous Task)
    - **Backend (`controllers/providers.js`):** Updated `AVAILABLE_MODELS` structure to include a `supportsVision: boolean` flag. Marked relevant OpenAI (gpt-4o, gpt-4-turbo), Anthropic Claude 3, and Gemini models as supporting vision.
    - **Backend (`controllers/chatMessages.js`):** Implemented provider-specific logic to handle multimodal input (text + image) for vision-capable models.
    - **Frontend (`components/ModelSelectorDropdown.tsx` & `.module.css`):** Updated to display a vision icon (`üëÅÔ∏è`) next to capable models.
- **File/Image Previews & Paste Functionality:** (Previous Task)
    - Implemented user-facing file/image previews, paste support, and rendering in chat.
    - Configured backend static file serving.

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md` and other relevant Memory Bank files.
- Present the completed task to the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Confirmed vision support for GPT-4.1 series models.
- Leveraged existing OpenAI vision implementation logic for the new models.
- Updated backend configuration (`providers.js`) to enable the feature for these models.
