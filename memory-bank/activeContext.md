# Active Context: CompassAI

## Current Work Focus
Implemented immediate display of uploaded images in chat messages without requiring a page refresh.

## Recent Changes
- **Implement Immediate Image Display:**
    - **Backend (`chatMessages.js`):** Modified `addMessageToSession` to send the complete, saved user message object (including `fileInfo`) back to the frontend immediately after creation. This is done via an early SSE event (`user_message_saved`) in streaming mode, or included in the main JSON response (`userMessage` key) in non-streaming mode.
    - **Frontend (`ChatPage.tsx`):** Updated `handleSendMessage` to handle the new backend response. It now listens for the `user_message_saved` SSE event (or checks the `userMessage` key in the non-streaming response) and uses the received complete message object to replace the initial optimistic user message in the `messages` state. This triggers a re-render showing the actual uploaded image.
- **Fix OpenAI Vision Input Formatting:** (Previous Task)
    - Corrected the `image_url` structure for OpenAI/Perplexity API calls in `backend/controllers/chatMessages.js`.
- **Fix Vision Input ReferenceError:** (Previous Task)
    - Adjusted code order in `backend/controllers/chatMessages.js` to fix variable initialization error.
- **Enable Vision for GPT-4.1 Series:** (Previous Task)
    - Updated `backend/controllers/providers.js` to flag GPT-4.1 models as supporting vision.
- **AI Vision Input Implementation:** (Previous Task)
    - Implemented backend logic and frontend UI for multimodal input (text + image) for OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini models.
- **File/Image Previews & Paste Functionality:** (Previous Task)
    - Implemented user-facing file/image previews, paste support, and rendering in chat. Configured backend static file serving.
    - Fixed image URL construction on frontend.

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md`.
- Present the completed task to the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Modified backend response to include the saved user message object.
- Updated frontend state management to replace optimistic messages with confirmed messages from the backend, enabling immediate image display.
