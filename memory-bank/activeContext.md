# Active Context: CompassAI

## Current Work Focus
Completing the task of adding a "Start New Chat" button to the chat page when there's no history.

## Recent Changes
- Added a "Start New Chat" button to `frontend/client/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx`. This button appears centered above the "Start a new chat..." message when the message list is empty. It uses the existing `handleNewChat` function.
- Analyzed backend models (User.js, Setting.js).
- Examined backend controllers (settings.js).
- Reviewed frontend components (SettingsPage.tsx, ChatPage.tsx).

## Next Steps
- Update `progress.md` to reflect the addition of the new button.
- Present the completed task to the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensured the new button integrates smoothly with the existing UI and functionality (`handleNewChat`).
- Used translation function `t` for the button text for localization.
- Reused existing CSS class `styles.sendButton` for initial styling.
- Ensuring that the Memory Bank is comprehensive and up-to-date.
- Identifying critical components and their interactions.
- Documenting the chat functionality and user settings management.
