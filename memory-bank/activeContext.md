# Active Context: CompassAI

## Current Work Focus
Implementing logic to load the most recently viewed/interacted chat session by default.

## Recent Changes
- **Load Last Viewed Session:**
    - Added `lastAccessedAt` field (Date, default: `Date.now`) to `backend/models/ChatSession.js`.
    - Modified `backend/controllers/chatMessages.js`:
        - Updated `lastAccessedAt` to `Date.now()` in `getMessagesForSession` (when viewing).
        - Updated `lastAccessedAt` to `Date.now()` in `addMessageToSession` (when interacting).
    - Modified `backend/controllers/chatSessions.js`:
        - Changed sorting in `getChatSessions` from `createdAt: -1` to `lastAccessedAt: -1`.
- Updated Memory Bank (`systemPatterns.md`, `progress.md`).

## Next Steps
- Present the completed task to the user.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- The frontend (`ChatPage.tsx`) already had logic to load the first session from the list returned by the API. By changing the backend sorting order to use `lastAccessedAt`, the frontend automatically picks up the most recently accessed session without needing modification.
- Setting `lastAccessedAt` default to `Date.now` ensures existing sessions have a value and new sessions initially sort by creation time until accessed.
- Updating the timestamp on both message fetch (`getMessagesForSession`) and message add (`addMessageToSession`) covers both viewing and interaction scenarios.
- Ensured the Memory Bank is comprehensive and up-to-date with these changes.
